# Components

The components in this folder are components ideally suited for being reused throughout the application.
These components are usually imported in the App.js. There they are passed down into each Tab component (the pages),
where they will be displayed.

## Things to keep in mind

- Components are passed down from src file

- When making components try to make them reusable

- Components often need specific data that's passed down to them from the Tab's index.js file
