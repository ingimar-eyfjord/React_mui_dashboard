# Functions

- This file contains functions that can be reused anywhere I recommend using this as a library for functions you would like to use, you can add a new file and export the desired class.

- exportXLS.js Is a component that exports JSON data to an excel sheet.

- ConverterClass.js converts data sent to it into the desired format, for example, `ConverterClass.formToJSON(elements)` returns a JSON array from the elements of a submitted form. I recommend using it when submitting a form.

- UseWindowSize.jsx is a react component that outputs the window size of the screen. Which is used for conditional rendering given what device the user is using.

## Things to keep in mind

- Make as many functions and components here

- Think of this as your code library
